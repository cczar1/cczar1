# Hello! I'm Catherine.

## About Me üëã

Experienced Contracts Administrator with a strong foundation in operational processes and compliance within secure, regulated environments. 

Currently transitioning into cybersecurity, leveraging a versatile professional background and CompTIA Security+ certification. 

I am passionate about applying cybersecurity knowledge in practical settings, with a focus on building technical skills through hands-on projects in a VirtualBox home lab.

## Current Focus

- Performing Linux system hardening and compliance audits
- Building SIEM alerting and detection use cases
- Practicing EDR/XDR incident triage workflows
- Exploring governance frameworks (NIST CSF 2.0, ISO 27001)
- Strengthening foundational IT support troubleshooting skills

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **SIEM:** Splunk
- **EDR/XDR:** Wazuh
- **System Security & Compliance:** Linux, Lynis, package management
- **Automation:** Python (scripts for auditing, log parsing), Linux CLI
- **GRC:** NIST CSF, ISO 27001

---

## Next Steps

- Expand SOC-related labs (log correlation, playbooks)
- Add more Python automation scripts for security tasks (e.g., password audits, log analysis, report generation)
- Develop sample risk assessments and vendor questionnaires
- Explore automated system hardening checks and remediation scripts in Python
